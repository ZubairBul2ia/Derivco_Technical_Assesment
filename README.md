# Derivco_Technical_Assesment  
 Hello! This is the technical assessment completed for Derivco as part of the graduate application.  
 ## Requirements
 Microsoft C#   
 .NET SDK | Runtime Environment  
 ## How to run
 The program is a simple C# console application. It was created in Visual Studio code, and can be launched by browsing to the "Good_Match_Assessment" directory in the terminal, and using the command "dotnet run"  
 The console application prompts the end-user to input two names, ensures they are alphabetic, and will match them.   
 Thereafter the results of the matching are ouput to the console, as well as the run-time.   
 The program then runs part 2, where it computes the matching results using the names in the "names.csv" file, and the sorted matches are stored alphabetically in "output.txt"
